# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Common questions about the AI Email Summarizer project.

---

## General Questions

### Q: What does this project do?
**A:** It automatically connects to your Gmail, fetches unread emails, and uses Google's Gemini AI to generate concise 3-5 bullet point summaries of each email. All summaries are saved in a Markdown file.

### Q: How much time does it save?
**A:** On average, 20-30 minutes per day. Instead of reading dozens of full emails, you read short AI-generated summaries.

### Q: Is it safe to use?
**A:** Yes! The script uses Gmail's official IMAP protocol and Google App Passwords (not your regular password). Your credentials are stored locally in a `.env` file that never gets uploaded to GitHub.

### Q: Does it work with other email providers?
**A:** Currently, it only supports Gmail. However, the code can be adapted for any IMAP-compatible email provider (Outlook, Yahoo, etc.).

## Setup Questions

### Q: Do I need a Gmail account?
**A:** Yes, currently the script only works with Gmail. You need a Gmail account with IMAP enabled.

### Q: What is an App Password?
**A:** An App Password is a 16-character password generated by Google specifically for third-party apps. It's more secure than using your regular Gmail password. You need 2-Factor Authentication enabled to generate one.

### Q: Where do I get a Gemini API key?
**A:** Sign up at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/), click "Get API key", and create a new API key.

### Q: Do I need to pay for Gemini?
**A:** No! Gemini 1.5 Flash has a generous free tier (15 requests per minute) that's perfect for personal email summarization. No credit card required.

### Q: Can I use a different AI model?
**A:** The code is designed for Gemini, but you could modify it to use other APIs like OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, or local models like Ollama.

## Technical Questions

### Q: What Python version do I need?
**A:** Python 3.8 or higher.

### Q: What dependencies are required?
**A:** Only 3 packages:
- `python-dotenv` - Environment variables
- `openai` - OpenAI API client
- `html2text` - HTML to text conversion

### Q: Does it mark emails as read?
**A:** No! The script only reads unread emails but doesn't mark them as read. They remain unread in your Gmail.

### Q: Can it handle attachments?
**A:** The script skips attachments and only processes email text content.

### Q: What if an email is HTML-only?
**A:** The script automatically converts HTML to plain text using the `html2text` library.

### Q: Does it support non-English emails?
**A:** Yes! The script handles various character encodings (UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, etc.) and works with any language.

## Usage Questions

### Q: How often should I run the script?
**A:** Whenever you want summaries! You can run it manually or set up automation to run it daily/hourly.

### Q: What happens if I have no unread emails?
**A:** The script will display "No unread emails found!" and exit gracefully.

### Q: Can I run it automatically every day?
**A:** Yes! You can use:
- **Windows**: Task Scheduler
- **macOS/Linux**: cron jobs

See the [SETUP_GUIDE.md](SETUP_GUIDE.md) for instructions.

### Q: Where are the summaries saved?
**A:** In a file called `email_summaries.md` in the project directory.

### Q: Can I customize the summary format?
**A:** Yes! Edit the `generate_summary()` function in `automate.py` to change the prompt or format.

---

## Cost Questions

### Q: How much does it cost to run?
**A:** 
- **Gmail**: Free
- **Gemini API**: FREE (within free tier limits)
- **Total**: **$0/month** for personal use!

### Q: Can I reduce costs?
**A:** Gemini is already FREE for personal use! The free tier (15 requests per minute) is more than enough for email summarization.

### Q: Are there paid options if I need more?
**A:** Yes! If you exceed the free tier, Gemini has very affordable paid tiers. But for personal email summarization, the free tier should be more than sufficient.

## Troubleshooting Questions

### Q: "Failed to connect to Gmail" error?
**A:** Common causes:
1. Using regular password instead of App Password
2. IMAP not enabled in Gmail
3. Incorrect email address

**Solution**: Double-check you're using the 16-character App Password from Google.

### Q: "Gemini API error" message?
**A:** Common causes:
1. Invalid API key
2. API quota exceeded (15 RPM on free tier)
3. Network issues

**Solution**: Verify your API key and check your quota in Google AI Studio.

### Q: "No module named 'dotenv'" error?
**A:** You haven't installed dependencies.

**Solution**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Q: Script runs but no summaries generated?
**A:** Check:
1. Do you have unread emails?
2. Is your OpenAI API key valid?
3. Do you have OpenAI credits?
4. Check the terminal output for errors

### Q: Summaries are poor quality?
**A:** Try:
1. Modifying the prompt in `generate_summary()`
2. Using a different Gemini model (e.g., gemini-1.5-pro)
3. Adjusting the prompt for more specific output

## Security Questions

### Q: Is my data safe?
**A:** Yes! 
- Credentials stored locally in `.env`
- No data sent anywhere except OpenAI API
- `.env` is gitignored (never uploaded to GitHub)

### Q: Can others see my emails?
**A:** No! The script runs locally on your machine. Only you can see the summaries.

### Q: Should I share my `.env` file?
**A:** **NEVER!** The `.env` file contains your credentials. Never commit it to Git or share it with anyone.

### Q: What if I accidentally commit `.env` to Git?
**A:** 
1. Remove it from Git: `git rm --cached .env`
2. Regenerate your App Password
3. Regenerate your OpenAI API key
4. Update `.env` with new credentials

### Q: How do I rotate my credentials?
**A:** 
1. Generate new App Password in Google
2. Generate new OpenAI API key
3. Update `.env` file
4. Delete old credentials

## Customization Questions

### Q: Can I change the number of bullet points?
**A:** Yes! Edit the prompt in `generate_summary()`:
```python
prompt = f"""Summarize in 5-7 bullet points..."""  # Change from 3-5
```

### Q: Can I filter emails by sender?
**A:** Yes! Modify the search query in `fetch_and_summarize_emails()`:
```python
status, messages = mail.search(None, 'UNSEEN FROM "sender@example.com"')
```

### Q: Can I summarize only today's emails?
**A:** Yes! Use date filtering:
```python
from datetime import date
today = date.today().strftime("%d-%b-%Y")
status, messages = mail.search(None, f'UNSEEN SINCE {today}')
```

### Q: Can I get summaries in a different language?
**A:** Yes! Modify the prompt:
```python
prompt = f"""Summarize in Spanish in 3-5 bullet points..."""
```

## Performance Questions

### Q: How long does it take to process emails?
**A:** About 2-3 seconds per email (mostly API call time).

### Q: Can I process 100+ emails at once?
**A:** Yes, but it will take time (3-5 minutes for 100 emails) and cost more in API fees.

### Q: Does it slow down my computer?
**A:** No, it's very lightweight and uses minimal resources.
